## Game Overview

**Tarati** is a strategic board game created by George Spencer-Brown, author of *Laws of Form*, which applies his
calculus of distinctions to gameplay. The game is minimalist in structure yet deep in consequence: players move, flip
enemy pieces, and promote their own through a board of 23 vertices arranged in concentric zones.

### Origin

Designed as a practical application of Brown's distinction calculus, Tarati embodies the mathematical and philosophical
principles from *Laws of Form* — a foundational work exploring logic through the concept of distinction.

---

## Core Rules

### Objective

Capture the last enemy piece in a single move (Mit) or leave the opponent with no legal moves (Stalemit).

### Board Structure

The board has 23 vertices distributed across four zones (not fully disjoint):

- **Absolute center**: 1 vertex (A1)
- **Bridge**: 6 vertices connecting the center to the circumference
- **Circumference**: 12 vertices forming the outer ring
- **Domestic bases**: 4 vertices per player (8 total); 2 are exclusive D-ring vertices and 2 are C-ring vertices shared
  with the circumference

Each player starts with 4 Cobs placed on their domestic base.

### Pieces

**Cob** — the basic piece. Moves forward only, along edges toward the opponent's side. Cannot move backward unless
promoted.

**Rok** — an upgraded Cob. Moves freely in any direction along any edge. A Cob becomes a Rok by entering any vertex of
the opponent's domestic base. A captured Rok retains its Rok status: it changes color but remains a Rok.

### Movement

A piece moves to an adjacent free vertex. Upon arriving, it flips every eligible enemy piece directly connected to that
vertex to the moving player's color.

Exception: a Cob on its own domestic base may move in any direction, but only if that move produces at least one
capture.

### Pre-Adjacency Rule

An enemy piece can only be captured if the moving piece **was not adjacent to it before the move**. Only enemy pieces
that are new neighbors of the destination — and were not already neighbors of the origin — are flipped. Pieces that were
already adjacent to the origin are protected.

This is the most important tactical rule in the game: you must approach from outside.

### Dead Pieces and Forced Promotion

A Cob can become **dead** — trapped with no way to advance. The patent defines two situations where this happens:

**Primary death.** A Cob that is captured and flipped onto one of the two outermost vertices of the opponent's base is
immediately dead. From those vertices there is no forward path: the piece cannot move on its own.

**Chain death.** A Cob is also dead if every forward-adjacent vertex is occupied by dead Cobs of the same color. This
condition propagates: a piece can die because it is blocked by another that died for the same reason, and so on. The
chain always ends at a primary dead vertex.

**What does not cause death.** A piece does not become dead from being blocked by an enemy piece, a live friendly Cob,
or a Rok of either color — because any of those blockers can move away and free the path. Only dead Cobs of the same
color block permanently. Roks are never dead.

**When a dead piece can be promoted.** Promoting a dead Cob to a Rok is not automatic. It only happens when the player
cannot make any normal move. In that case, the player may promote one of their dead Cobs — but only if the resulting Rok
would have at least one move available. If the promotion does not resolve the immobility, that piece cannot be promoted.

**Special case — last piece.** If a Cob is the player's only remaining piece on the board, it must be promoted to a Rok
unconditionally, regardless of where it is and even if the player can still move other pieces.

### End Conditions

The game ends when:

- **Mit**: a player captures all enemy pieces in a single move.
- **Stalemit**: the active player has no normal moves and no forced promotions available. The opponent wins.
- **Triple repetition**: the same board position appears three times with the same player to move. The player who caused
  the third repetition loses.
- **50-move rule**: if 100 consecutive half-moves pass without a Cob move or any promotion, the active player may claim
  a draw. A player with a winning move available may not claim.
- **Time out**: in timed games, the player who exceeds their time limit loses.
